## Abstract

**A Pythond Modelling Implementation.**

American perpetual compound options, not relying on bivariate or multivariate distribution function. 
This model is especially applicable for a real sequential investment opportunity, 
such as a series of drug development, tests and clinical trials,
where the project can be cancelled at any time, and where the probability of failure declines over
stages of completion. 

The effect of changing input parameter values can clearly be seen in terms
of resulting overall project process volatility, and the effective mark-up factor which justifies
continuing with each investment stage. 

This study
appears to be a unique approach, which yields the threshold project value relative to investment
costs that justifies investment at each stage, with no timing restrictions.
